Company has to pay the minimum wage, in order to comply with the law (current is 7.25)
Living wage is what it takes for someone to live a minimally suitable decent life
  $15 an hour is what people say the living wage is.

Minimum wge only increases when congress signs a law to do it.
  -This means that the minimum wage is not keeping up with Inflation

Implications of federal setting a living wage:
  -The cost of living is hugely different from one city to another (especially housing)
  -Unemployment for High Schoolers would rise, because the more expensive a job is, the more likely it is to get fired.
  -Business could nd up out of business
  -Business could t benefits
  -Business could Inrease Prices
  -Business could automate more jobs

Business work on Return on Investment
  -If spending 2 million on $200,000 worth of jobs, not worth
  -If spending same amount on $400,000 worth of jobs, big worth

"No business that depends on paying a low wage has a right to exist in this country" - FDR
Business' that would be impacted: Factories, Fast Food, Retail Stores

So what should we do with the disparity between minimum and living wages?
  - Leaving it into the hands of the states
    - What we are currently doing. Not completely solved the problem

  - We caught up the federal minimum wage to cover the last decade of inflation, and then index it to inflation
  - Increase the amount of food stamps, help low low class
  
  - What would happen if minimum wage to 9
    - People who are making like 10 would want a raise, and not be too happy about it.
    - This new minimum would effect people outside of the target audience
    
  - If wages get higher, companies may:
    - Shrink the number of jobs
    - They might outsource
    - They might raise prices
    - Offer less benefits
  
  -Job training, educational programs, investing in the people's skills.

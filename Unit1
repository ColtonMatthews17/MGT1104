All stockholders are stakeholders
not all stakeholders are stockholders

Stakeholders: People who have positive interest in the results of the company

Employees, CEO's, Local community, banks, landlords, and investors are potential stakeholders.

Competitors want them to fail
Stakeholders want them to succeed

PESTAL Model allows business to ensure they have though thouroughly about macro, or all the aspects of the world around them.
  These outside forces can really affect the success of the business

P - Political. Taxes and tariffs can seriously affect business success. Tariffs effects all across the country
E - Economic. The economy gives purchasing power to the consumers. In a good economy, more people have more money to spend
      Having a good economy is not always beneficial for the business (EX: Food market, resturant)
S - Sociocultural. Demographic trends (Ex: Raising obesity in US allows more weightloss business'. Healthcare costs increase)
                   Attitudes. Big societal shifts in attitude (Ex: Green movement, better for companies who are eco-friendly)
T - Technological. Internet. HUGE business' (uber, lyft, google, apple, e-commerce) came about because of the internet
                   Automation. Tesla has enormous robots that automates almost the entire process of building a car.
                    This has a negative impact of jobs. EX: Less cashiers, more self-checkouts machines
E - Environmental Force. Natural Items found Ex: Minerals, Oil. Supply of natural resources seriously effect prices of secondary products
          EX: Oil prices
L - Legal Environment. Same as Political.

REAL LIFE EXAMPLE:

Electric Cars

They might become the dominant driving option

As gas becomes more expensive / run out of supply
Politicians could influence people to buy electric cars IE subsities / tax breaks
T - Mechanics dont really know how to repair electric cars yet. This complementary service isnt built up enough currently
T - Charge mileage. Miles / Charge. Right now the range of an electric car is way smaller than an average gas-car
The technology has to be more affordable and lower prices. They have to be affordable for the typical consumer

Profit / Margin:  Revenue - Costs
Revenue: Sales. All the money the business takes in
Income:  Income can mean alot of things, so you need to have another descriptive word with it. Cant e used by itself
  Ex: Household income, Gross income. It can be made to equate to revenue or profit or others

Functions of a business:

Management: Top management has strategy thinking, finds its goals, essentially "how are we going to run the company?"
Operations does production. Any product thats being prouced goes through operations.
Marketing: What can we deliver that satifies the customers. Pricing, how theyre gonna get the product to the market
  "What are the customers going to want in 5 years?"
Accounting: Official scorekeepers. they produce information that goes out to investors, they keep record of what goes on inside the company
    Recording transactions, financial transactions
Human Resources: they deal with all people realted stuff. Hiring, firing, bonus programs, benefits,
      schedules (amount of shifts), employe grievances, dealing with employee unions
Finance: people who make sure there is enough money to run the business. they decide how to fund the company
Information Technology: every business has online shopping and other small programs to keep them updated.

Measuring the Health of the Economy

Main goals that are common to any successful economy:
  -High employment
  -Economic Growth (GDP)
  -Price Stability (not that the prices stay the same, but that over time as prices go up, it is predictable and orderly)
  -Inflation (orderly, gradual level of inflation, 2% is the good number of inflation in a ny given year)

GDP: Gross Domestic Product, or by definition, the value of final goods and services produced in any given time

USA 2018 Economy Size is 19.4 Trillion

We measure GDP every quarter, and they measure it either by season (compare this fall to last fall) or by year

Iceland's economy is growing at 10%

Unemployment:
  Multiple ways of measuring unemploment:
    -U3- most favorable unemployment measurment
      -Current U3 unemployment is 3.7%
        -Very uncomplete measure on unemployment because it does not account for discouraged people who dont have jobs, and arent looking for one
        -Also does not account for people who have part-time jobs, and are unable to find a full-time job
    -U6 does account for these discouraged people and part-time jobs people.
      -Currrent U6 unemployment is 6.5%

Inflation:
  -The most common measure of inflation is CPI (Consumer Price Index)
    -The CPI makes up a "basket of goods" that the typical household is going to buy, and compares the price of that hypothetical
     basket from year to year, evalutaing the inflation
  -The less common measure of inflation is PPI (producer price index)
    -This is almost the exact same, except is measure the items that business' / producers would buy, and not the typical household

Deflation:
  -Opposite of inflation
  -Consumers may defer purchasing an item if the economy is experiencing deflation because consumers know the price will decrease later
    -If many consumers do this, than there will be extra supply, leading to people getting fired, meaning less people have money in their pocket, leading into a recession

Recession: When GDP goes down for two consecutive quarters ** hinted at exam
  -emphasis on consecutive. this definition also does not speak at all to magnitude
    -Ex: the ecnomony going down .1% twie in a row, versus 5% twice in a row
    
Depression: There is no agreed upon definition of depression
  -A depression is when there is a really really bad recession


Balance of Trade: (From a countries perspective) difference between imports and exports with a trading partner
  -based on the difference, you can have either a trade surplus, or a trade deficit
    -Surplus is when you are exporting more than importing
    -Deficit is when you are importing more than exporting
  -Trade deficit / surplus is calculated by simple subtraction or imports - exports **hinted at exam

US is in huge trading deficit

Balance of Payments: the money exchange from country to country
  -Balance of trade is goods / services, balance of payments is strictly money
    -Countries borrow from one another

National Debt: the amount the federal government owes to borrowers
  -Current National Debt is 22 trillion dollars
    -Currently growing very very fast (this year could be 1 trillion dollars)

Economic Indicators:
  -Measurements that tell you how the conomy is doing
  -Two types, lagging and leading
    -Lagging: looks in the rearview mirror, and does not tell you anything about the future
      -Ex: GDP growth and unemployment rate
    -Leading: something that has direct predictive value going into the future
      -Ex: Housing permits. people that want to built a house or do a renovation, they have to file a permit
        -There might be more people signing up to build houses this year than last year
        -There are many jobs going into building a house, giving the housing sector a good overlook.
      -Ex: Purchasing Manager Index (PMI): they go around to purchasing managers to a bunch of companies and ask them how much stuff they are going to buy
        -Ex: a random company might buy 3% less stuff

Business Plans turn back in by Monday
Friday is Alumni Roundtable
20 points of the final paper is incorporating what we heard at the alumni roundtable
Monday is our first case, read about it before class for class discussion

Todays Lesson: Ethics

Rationalizing: Making your illegal action / unethical action seem right possibly though excuses.
  -Well everyone else is doing it
  -Its only 7c in royalties
  -Migos makin millions, what is $2 gonna do

Ethics: The standards that we set as a society to help us differ what is right or wrong
  Ethics differ by country.

Whistleblowing: When you decide to take action on something that you see that is 
                taking place in a business / country and you decide to take it upon yourelf to do something about it.

There are risks involved with being the whistleblower.
  -Ostracized
  -Getting fired

Corporate Social Responsibility: When a company decides to do more than the law requires to do the right thing
  Ex: Toms, when you buy a pair of shoes, they give a pair to a struggling country
  Ex: Cleaning your emisions more than required by law.

Trynig to push US ethical standards onto other countries is not good
  -Causes conflict
  -Their culture, their country
  -Just because its in the US, doesnt mean it should be entire world.

Flip Side
  -If you do allow them to do their standards, you could occur reputational damages
    -Ex: Nike used to buy products in Southeast Asia and their standards are very different
            -They tanked a bunched and then forced US ethical standards onto their suppliers 

Insider Trading: Getting information from a company before it goes public, and acting on that information to profit
                  -Ex: Apple is about to announce a new phone, so you buy a ton of stocks and makes money

Ethical Issue: Big societal issues like Climate Change. Broad Societal Problem
Ethical Dilemma: Something that deals with a conflict of interest. Personal Conflict
                    Ex: When you have to choose between whats best for you, and whats best for the company.

Company has to pay the minimum wage, in order to comply with the law (current is 7.25)
Living wage is what it takes for someone to live a minimally suitable decent life
  $15 an hour is what people say the living wage is.

Minimum wge only increases when congress signs a law to do it.
  -This means that the minimum wage is not keeping up with Inflation

Implications of federal setting a living wage:
  -The cost of living is hugely different from one city to another (especially housing)
  -Unemployment for High Schoolers would rise, because the more expensive a job is, the more likely it is to get fired.
  -Business could nd up out of business
  -Business could t benefits
  -Business could Inrease Prices
  -Business could automate more jobs

Business work on Return on Investment
  -If spending 2 million on $200,000 worth of jobs, not worth
  -If spending same amount on $400,000 worth of jobs, big worth

"No business that depends on paying a low wage has a right to exist in this country" - FDR
Business' that would be impacted: Factories, Fast Food, Retail Stores

So what should we do with the disparity between minimum and living wages?
  - Leaving it into the hands of the states
    - What we are currently doing. Not completely solved the problem

  - We caught up the federal minimum wage to cover the last decade of inflation, and then index it to inflation
  - Increase the amount of food stamps, help low low class
  
  - What would happen if minimum wage to 9
    - People who are making like 10 would want a raise, and not be too happy about it.
    - This new minimum would effect people outside of the target audience
    
  - If wages get higher, companies may:
    - Shrink the number of jobs
    - They might outsource
    - They might raise prices
    - Offer less benefits
  
  -Job training, educational programs, investing in the people's skills.

Globalization: The trend of economies around the world towards becoming more interconnected with each other
                - The internet has made is much more possible for companies to o business abroad
                  - Problem in one country has effects on other countries

Balance of Trade: The relationship between imports and exports
                    Trade deficit: Imports > Exports, Trade surplus: Imports < Exports
Balance of Payments: The borrowing / lending of money between countries


Global Entry Strategies
  Risk and Return Potential (From Low to High)
    Licensing, Export, Franchising, Contract MFG, Strategic Alliance, JV, FDI

Licensing 
  -Get paid through royalties, the mistakes of the international company has no impact on your
    business because your brand isnt on their product
Export
  -Make a new product, ship it over to another country and sell it there
    -Risky because it has your brand name, but has a higher return potential
Franchising
  -All franchising has license agreements
  -People cannot tell the difference between franchise and company store
  -Parent company is more strict on the regulations on the franchisee
  -Parent company gets a royalty
  -You are buying the rights to their name, color scheme, logo, etc
  
  -Advantages: Lots of management help, market research, how to set up the store, how to staff the store.
                 The franchise has lots of experience
               -You get the benefit of all the corporate advertising
               -You get the benefit of having an internationally known brand name
                  Customers are much more likely to go to a place they recognize
  -Disadvantages: Big big upront investment for licensing and store
                -Has to share profits through royalties
                -Buy raw materials from supplies or maybe from company themselve
                -Retrictions based on what you are allowed to sell
                -When something goes wrong in another part of the network, can carry a negative impact to your store

   Good for the big business because it uses other peoples money to open a new store.
                
Contract Manufacturing
  -FoxConn is making apple's products to apples regulations. Apple recieves those products and sells them to their customers
  -Big differentiator between this and licensing, is that the brand name goes on the product.
    -Tends to be big huge companies
  -The overseas manufacturor only sells to the parent company, parent company sells to their clients
Strategic Alliance
  -Can use this and Joint Venture interchangably
  -When two companies get together to work on some type of idea together, without creating a new business
    -Lyft and GM does their own thing, but they both has teams working together to help get to self driving cars
    -This eliminates them competing with each other.
Joint Venture
  -Two companies are engaged in similar industries and they decide to put pieces of their companies together to create  
      a thrid company
  -Each company owned 50% and shared profits together, also they combined the best characteristics of each compan
  -Synergy is the benefit of combining two companies to get a better product,
    that you would not get if they were left seperate
Foreign Driven Investment
  -Company puts money directly into foreign market
  -Mercedes building a factory in the US to make a transit cans
    -Very risky because they invested all their money, but they get 100% of profits


Terminology associated with Trade Protectionism
  Tariff: Tax on imports
    -Paid buy the import
    -It is a form of trade protectionism
    -Products made in the home market should have a better chance competing

  Import Quote: You can only import a specific quantity of a product
    -Protects US steel business because China produces steel at a cheaper rate than US
  
  Dumping: When a company exports a product at a cheaper price then they can sell in their home country
    -Illegal under world trade organization
  
  Subsity: The government gives money to the producer
    -Trump giving money to US farmer producers because China is importing less
    -Canadian dairy farmers subsidize their farmers heavily to help them
    
  Embargo: A total ban on an export into a country
    -US has embargo on Iran
  
  Exchange Rate: How much of another countries currency can you buy with yours
    -Exchange rate between dollar and euro is 1.12
    -Conversion rate
  
  Outsourcing: 
    -Its cheaper to get labor in other countries right now
      -This speeds up globalization
    -Sometimes companies outsource to find talent in other countries
      -Company in india coded an american company because lack of developers in U.S.
      
    RISKS: lose jobs in the home market, reputational damage, quality or safety issues, language barrier
      Products made in other countries might not have same safety standards

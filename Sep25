  Risk and Return Potential (From Low to High)
    Licensing, Export, Franchising, Contract MFG, Strategic Alliance, JV, FDI

Licensing

    business because your brand isnt on their product
Export

    -Risky because it has your brand name, but has a higher return potential
Franchising
  -All franchising has license agreements
  -People cannot tell the difference between franchise and company store
  -Parent company is more strict on the regulations on the franchisee
  -Parent company gets a royalty
  -You are buying the rights to their name, color scheme, logo, etc

                 The franchise has lots of experience
               -You get the benefit of all the corporate advertising
               -You get the benefit of having an internationally known brand name

  -Disadvantages: Big big upront investment for licensing and store
                -Has to share profits through royalties
                -Buy raw materials from supplies or maybe from company themselve
                -Retrictions based on what you are allowed to sell
                -When something goes wrong in another part of the network, can carry a negative impact to your store

    that you would not get if they were left seperate

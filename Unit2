    -Share textbooks among classmates
    -Put pressure on the administrators/university to keep class costs to a minimum
    
  -What would you do if you were Pearson
    -Subscription model might work
    -If they merged with a competitor, they would get benefits like:
      -Less competition
      -Costs savings (cutting number of sales people, almost halving employees)

October 9th

Business Liability: How much you can limit how much you can be sued for
  Unlimited Liabilty: Owners can be sued for their personal property
  Limited Liability: Only the value of the company itself can be taken
    Liability is etermind by what type of business you set up
Business Formation:
  -Sole Proprietership
  -Partnership
    Basically the same as sole prop. but with multiple people
  -Limited Partnership
    One general partner (same role as sole prop), and unlimited people who have limited liability
    VERY similar to partnership, besides the liability aspect
  -Corporation
    Ownership very fluid through stock market
    Double tax: pay taxes on income, then they pay dividends to people who own stocks.
                Those people then have to pay taxes on their dividends (income tax)
                  Stock holders dont get charged if the company makes a loss
  -LLC (Limited Liability Company)
    Way to get limited liability for small companies
    State approved LLC, pays $50 a year to stay registered
  
Taking a picture of a chart during notes to look at advantages and disadvantages

Non-Profits
  -Operates very similarly to a business, but are not allowed to profit off of anything.

Mergers and aquisitions
  -Difference: Mergers: companies that are relatively equal in size, who voluntarily become one
               Aquisitions: The bigger company will usually buy out the smaller company. 
                -Very often the smaller company is left intact and the positions are not eliminated
 The main idea for these two things are:
   Synergy: The benefits of the companies coming together that they wouldnt have if they stayed seperate
                  Save a whole lot of costs eliminating redundant positions
            
   Complimentary products: Apple buying netflix, Facebook and Oculus
   
   Access to new markets: company bought a foreign company and immediately gains a new marketing team and distributing
    team in that foreign market
   
   one other one i missed
   
Hostile takeover: One company resists being bought from another company.
          One way: buy out all the shares for a company strictly from the stock market, bypassing management
            -Most of the time, management are not owners/shareholders

Less than half of mergers and aquisitions realize the full befits
  Corporate Culture Differences limit the productivity of mergers and aquisitions

Production Methods
  -Mass production:
    -Producing high volume of an identical item,
      at a cost low enough to price them for large numbers of customers.

  -Mass Customization:
    -Produce a high volume of product to a certain point in the production process,

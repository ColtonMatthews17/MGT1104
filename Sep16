Measuring the Health of the Economy

Main goals that are common to any successful economy:
  -High employment
  -Economic Growth (GDP)
  -Price Stability (not that the prices stay the same, but that over time as prices go up, it is predictable and orderly)
  -Inflation (orderly, gradual level of inflation, 2% is the good number of inflation in a ny given year)

GDP: Gross Domestic Product, or by definition, the value of final goods and services produced in any given time

USA 2018 Economy Size is 19.4 Trillion

We measure GDP every quarter, and they measure it either by season (compare this fall to last fall) or by year

Iceland's economy is growing at 10%

Unemployment:
  Multiple ways of measuring unemploment:
    -U3- most favorable unemployment measurment
      -Current U3 unemployment is 3.7%
        -Very uncomplete measure on unemployment because it does not account for discouraged people who dont have jobs, and arent looking for one
        -Also does not account for people who have part-time jobs, and are unable to find a full-time job
    -U6 does account for these discouraged people and part-time jobs people.
      -Currrent U6 unemployment is 6.5%

Inflation:
  -The most common measure of inflation is CPI (Consumer Price Index)
    -The CPI makes up a "basket of goods" that the typical household is going to buy, and compares the price of that hypothetical
     basket from year to year, evalutaing the inflation
  -The less common measure of inflation is PPI (producer price index)
    -This is almost the exact same, except is measure the items that business' / producers would buy, and not the typical household

Deflation:
  -Opposite of inflation
  -Consumers may defer purchasing an item if the economy is experiencing deflation because consumers know the price will decrease later
    -If many consumers do this, than there will be extra supply, leading to people getting fired, meaning less people have money in their pocket, leading into a recession

Recession: When GDP goes down for two consecutive quarters ** hinted at exam
  -emphasis on consecutive. this definition also does not speak at all to magnitude
    -Ex: the ecnomony going down .1% twie in a row, versus 5% twice in a row
    
Depression: There is no agreed upon definition of depression
  -A depression is when there is a really really bad recession


Balance of Trade: (From a countries perspective) difference between imports and exports with a trading partner
  -based on the difference, you can have either a trade surplus, or a trade deficit
    -Surplus is when you are exporting more than importing
    -Deficit is when you are importing more than exporting
  -Trade deficit / surplus is calculated by simple subtraction or imports - exports **hinted at exam

US is in huge trading deficit

Balance of Payments: the money exchange from country to country
  -Balance of trade is goods / services, balance of payments is strictly money
    -Countries borrow from one another

National Debt: the amount the federal government owes to borrowers
  -Current National Debt is 22 trillion dollars
    -Currently growing very very fast (this year could be 1 trillion dollars)

Economic Indicators:
  -Measurements that tell you how the conomy is doing
  -Two types, lagging and leading
    -Lagging: looks in the rearview mirror, and does not tell you anything about the future
      -Ex: GDP growth and unemployment rate
    -Leading: something that has direct predictive value going into the future
      -Ex: Housing permits. people that want to built a house or do a renovation, they have to file a permit
        -There might be more people signing up to build houses this year than last year
        -There are many jobs going into building a house, giving the housing sector a good overlook.
      -Ex: Purchasing Manager Index (PMI): they go around to purchasing managers to a bunch of companies and ask them how much stuff they are going to buy
        -Ex: a random company might buy 3% less stuff

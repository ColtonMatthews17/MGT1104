Todays Lesson: Ethics

Rationalizing: Making your illegal action / unethical action seem right possibly though excuses.
  -Well everyone else is doing it
  -Its only 7c in royalties
  -Migos makin millions, what is $2 gonna do

Ethics: The standards that we set as a society to help us differ what is right or wrong
  Ethics differ by country.

Whistleblowing: When you decide to take action on something that you see that is 
                taking place in a business / country and you decide to take it upon yourelf to do something about it.

There are risks involved with being the whistleblower.
  -Ostracized
  -Getting fired

Corporate Social Responsibility: When a company decides to do more than the law requires to do the right thing
  Ex: Toms, when you buy a pair of shoes, they give a pair to a struggling country
  Ex: Cleaning your emisions more than required by law.

Trynig to push US ethical standards onto other countries is not good
  -Causes conflict
  -Their culture, their country
  -Just because its in the US, doesnt mean it should be entire world.

Flip Side
  -If you do allow them to do their standards, you could occur reputational damages
    -Ex: Nike used to buy products in Southeast Asia and their standards are very different
            -They tanked a bunched and then forced US ethical standards onto their suppliers 

Insider Trading: Getting information from a company before it goes public, and acting on that information to profit
                  -Ex: Apple is about to announce a new phone, so you buy a ton of stocks and makes money

Ethical Issue: Big societal issues like Climate Change. Broad Societal Problem
Ethical Dilemma: Something that deals with a conflict of interest. Personal Conflict
                    Ex: When you have to choose between whats best for you, and whats best for the company.

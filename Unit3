Chapter 13: Union/Management Issues

Labor Union
—an organized group of workers that bargains with employers to improve its members’ pay, 
  job security, and working conditions.

Historival Benefits that Union has brought to Society:
  -Better Working Conditions
  -Increase Job Security
  -Better Pay (Minimum Wage Law)
  -Child Labor Laws
  -40 Hour Work Week, and more hours is overtime
  -Anti-Discrimination Laws

Strike: The members do not go to work, in hope the owners will change some aspect of their job
  -i.e better pay, better conditions
  -People do not get paid
  
Lockout: When the owners close the plant/factory to prevent the workers from working
  -The company still pays the workers

Collective Bargaining: Management and employees meeting to try to reach an agreement to end the 
  strike or lockout.

If a third party negotiator is involved to help with issues with company and employees:

Mediation: They bring in a third party, and the third party does not have any authority to force the company 
  to agree to the compensation

Arbitration: They bring in a third party, and the third party HAS THE AUTHORITY to force the company and 
  union to accept their proposed compensation

Right to Work Law: You do not have to join a union in order to work.

Open shop agreement: A person who wants to work somewhere has the right to not join a union even if
  there is one associated with the company

Sexual Harassment: Unwelcome sexual advances that create a hostile work environment
  -Can be comments, jokes, touching

Why companies dont like unions:
  -More expensive
    -More pay, more vacation time
  -Time addressing union issues
    -Greivances
  -Reputation damage
  -Strikes / Slowdowns cost

GM Strike
  -Ended 2 days ago, GM lost 2 billion dollars 
  -Union lost 1 billion dollars in wages
  -Workers got a 3% raise every other year and a 4% lump sum on the off years
  -Company did agree to no cap on profit sharing
  -Factory in detriot is going to stay open (saves a ton of jobs)
  -Factory in Ohio did not reopen
  -Ultimately, both sides lost alot of money

  Marketing
    -Not just ads
    -Starts with "What do customers want?"
    -Designing products and services
    -Keeping the customers happy
  
Four P's (producers point of view)
  -Product
  -Price
  -Place
  -Promotion

Slotting Costs: When you have a product, and you want a retail store to sell your product
  You have to buy a "slot" in their store.

You have to have a balance of the four p's

Four C's (consumers point of view)
  -Consumer (What does the consumer want)
  -Cost
  -Convenience
  -Communication

The four P's and four C's directly relate to each other

Showrooming: A consumer uses a retailer as a showroom, then buys the product online
  Ex: goes into a store to see all options, then buys on amazon

Market Research
  -Personal Interviewing
    -Asking people what needs they have
  -Survey
  -Focus Groups
    -With a focus group, you can bring together a group of individuals (perhaps six to ten) and ask them questions.
    -A trained moderator can explain the purpose of the group and lead the discussion. 
  -Purchase Data
  
Market Segmentation

Demograpic Segmentation: How to break up the market into peices to land the product on the right audience
  -Demographics, Income, Race, Gender

Geographic segmentation—dividing a market according to such variables as climate, region, and population density

Behavioral Segmentation: Ex: frequent fliers

Psychographic segmentation:
  Classifies consumers on the basis of individual lifestyles as they’re reflected in people’s interests, activities, attitudes, and values. 

Companies can use more than one type of segmentation to target their audience
  -This is known as Clustering

Nitch Marketing:
  -Very narrow market segmentation in which you try to meeet the needs of that small audience very well
    in order to have that audience still buy your product at a higher price.

Test Market: Companies see how a small amount of consumers react to a change to a product,
  to see how that would impact your entire audience

Trademark: a symbol, word, or words legally registered or established by use as representing a company or product

Branding:
  -Private Branding
    -A company makes a product and sells it to a retailer who in turn resells it under its own name.
  -Generic Branding
    -The maker attaches no branding information to a product except a description of its contents
  -Manufacturer Branding
    -A company sells one or more products under its own brand names
    
    -Adopting a multiproduct-branding approach, it sells many products under one brand name
    
    -Using a multibranding approach, the company assigns different brand names to products
      covering different segments of the market.

Brand Equity: Any added value generated by favorable consumer experiences with a brand

Types of Retailers:

  -Department Store
    -You walk into the store and its organized by categories
    -Higher end, Higher priced things. 
    -EX: Nordstrom, Macy's

  -Supermarket
    -Offers mostly consumer staples such as food and other household items
    -Ex: Kroger, Giant

  -Warehouse Clubs
   -Offers a wide variety of products in a warehouse-style setting; sells many products in bulk; usually requires membership fee
   -Decor of the store is minimal. Not visually appealing
   -Usually save money by buying in bulk
   -Ex: Costco, Sam/s Club

  -Convenience Store
    -Offers food, beverages, and other products, typically in individual servings, at a higher price, and geared to fast service
    -Ex: 7-Eleven

  -Category Killer
   -Sells a wide variety of products of a particular type, selling at a low price due to their large scale
   -Ex: Dick's Sporting Goods

  -Specialty Store

   -Ex: Local running stores / jewelry shops

  -Off-Price

Nov 4-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cost-Based Pricing: Used when you are developing something and you dont know exactly how much its gonna cost to develop
  Ex: Lockheed and Navy. Navy agreed to pay whatever it costed lockheed PLUS a pre-agreed upon profit

Value Pricing: 

Introductory PrIcing Strategies:
  Penetration Pricing: Release the product on the market at a low price, so that you can take alot of market share
  Skimming: Initially pricing the product very high, and then lowering the price again and again to see how many consumers
    would pay for the product at each price.

Mark-Up: The amount of money that you added to your cost to make a profit
  Buy at 50c, sell for 75c. Mark-Up is 25c
  COST + MARKUP = SELLING PRICE
  MARKUP % = MARK-UP / COST

Pricing Strategies:
  Dynamic Pricing: Hotels / Airplanes. They charge higher when the demand is high, and charge less
    when demand is low.
    Hotels and airlines use sophisticated revenue management tools to forecast demand and adjust the availability of various price points. 

  Prestige Pricing: You put a higher price on a product so people see it as higher quality.
    Ex: Rolex
    You are paying for the brand name / bragging rights.

  Odd-Even Pricing: pricing products a few cents (or dollars) under an even number
    Ex: pricing at 9.99 instead of 10 or 99.99 instead of 100

  Bundling: pricing items as a group, or bundle, at a discount to the cost of buying the items separately
    Ex: #1 at chickfila is cheaper than all individual items seperately.

ASK ABOUT ILLEGAL GLOBAL ENTRY STRAT
  Loss Leader: Price at a lower price than your cost.
    pricing an item at a loss to draw customers into the store.
    
  Once there, store managers hope that the customer will either buy accessories to go along with the new purchase
  or actually select a different item not priced at a loss.

Product Life Cycle
  Introduction:
    People dont really know the product
    Objective
      Get consumers aware
      Get consumers to buy the product
  Growth:
    Massive number of people going into the market and there is a big ramp
    
  Shakeout:
    When the weaker players fall out of the market
    Cant complete with established players
    **While sales are growing, the number of sellers are decreasing
    
  Maturity:
    When the market is in a replacement mode
    Not alot of new business, just replacement.
    Its just the competitors left that are probably gonna make it a long time.
    This is where the companies make the most money.
    No need to spend as much for advertising.
    
  Decline:
    Buyers and sellers are both leaving the market.
    The buyers leave the market, so the sellers also leave.
    Market is shrinking

Remember:
  
  What happens in shakeout
  Where the profits are the highest
  What are the objectives of each stage

A fad occurs when this whole cycle occurs within 6 months

Not all products follow this life cycle
  Ex: SUV's in 2008

Pricing Implications of Competitive Strategy:
  Differentiation and Low Cost
    Selling cheaper because low costs
    Being able to get the customer to pay more because differentiation

Question: Why is Other Current more Liquid than Securities

Accoutning uses T accounts

Every account has a credit and debit side

Things you OWN go on debit side
Things you OWE go on credit side

Must always balance credits and debits in accounting

Debit Side: Assets and Expenses

Conveneice sells at 4
Markup 25%
THEY PAY 3.2

MARGIN: 1.7
Cost 1.50
foed 340,000

340,000 / 1.7 = *200,000*

They sell at  1000
Markup 25%
They pay 800
Cost for us 250

Margin 550
Fixed costs 27,500,000  / 550

Chapter 13: Union/Management Issues

Labor Union
—an organized group of workers that bargains with employers to improve its members’ pay, 
  job security, and working conditions.

Historival Benefits that Union has brought to Society:
  -Better Working Conditions
  -Increase Job Security
  -Better Pay (Minimum Wage Law)
  -Child Labor Laws
  -40 Hour Work Week, and more hours is overtime
  -Anti-Discrimination Laws

Strike: The members do not go to work, in hope the owners will change some aspect of their job
  -i.e better pay, better conditions
  -People do not get paid
  
Lockout: When the owners close the plant/factory to prevent the workers from working
  -The company still pays the workers

Collective Bargaining: Management and employees meeting to try to reach an agreement to end the 
  strike or lockout.

If a third party negotiator is involved to help with issues with company and employees:

Mediation: They bring in a third party, and the third party does not have any authority to force the company 
  to agree to the compensation

Arbitration: They bring in a third party, and the third party HAS THE AUTHORITY to force the company and 
  union to accept their proposed compensation

Right to Work Law: You do not have to join a union in order to work.

Open shop agreement: A person who wants to work somewhere has the right to not join a union even if
  there is one associated with the company

Sexual Harassment: Unwelcome sexual advances that create a hostile work environment
  -Can be comments, jokes, touching

Why companies dont like unions:
  -More expensive
    -More pay, more vacation time
  -Time addressing union issues
    -Greivances
  -Reputation damage
  -Strikes / Slowdowns cost

GM Strike

  Marketing
    -Not just ads
    -Starts with "What do customers want?"
    -Designing products and services
    -Keeping the customers happy
  
Four P's (producers point of view)
  -Product
  -Price
  -Place
  -Promotion

Slotting Costs: When you have a product, and you want a retail store to sell your product
  You have to buy a "slot" in their store.

You have to have a balance of the four p's

Four C's (consumers point of view)
  -Consumer (What does the consumer want)
  -Cost
  -Convenience
  -Communication

The four P's and four C's directly relate to each other

Showrooming: A consumer uses a retailer as a showroom, then buys the product online
  Ex: goes into a store to see all options, then buys on amazon

Market Research
  -Personal Interviewing
    -Asking people what needs they have
  -Survey
  -Focus Groups
    -With a focus group, you can bring together a group of individuals (perhaps six to ten) and ask them questions.
    -A trained moderator can explain the purpose of the group and lead the discussion. 
  -Purchase Data
  
Market Segmentation

Demograpic Segmentation: How to break up the market into peices to land the product on the right audience
  -Demographics, Income, Race, Gender

Geographic segmentation—dividing a market according to such variables as climate, region, and population density

Behavioral Segmentation: Ex: frequent fliers

Psychographic segmentation:
  Classifies consumers on the basis of individual lifestyles as they’re reflected in people’s interests, activities, attitudes, and values. 

Companies can use more than one type of segmentation to target their audience
  -This is known as Clustering

Nitch Marketing:
  -Very narrow market segmentation in which you try to meeet the needs of that small audience very well
    in order to have that audience still buy your product at a higher price.

Test Market: Companies see how a small amount of consumers react to a change to a product,
  to see how that would impact your entire audience

Trademark: a symbol, word, or words legally registered or established by use as representing a company or product

Branding:
  -Private Branding
    -A company makes a product and sells it to a retailer who in turn resells it under its own name.
  -Generic Branding
    -The maker attaches no branding information to a product except a description of its contents
  -Manufacturer Branding
    -A company sells one or more products under its own brand names
    
    -Adopting a multiproduct-branding approach, it sells many products under one brand name
    
    -Using a multibranding approach, the company assigns different brand names to products
      covering different segments of the market.

Brand Equity: Any added value generated by favorable consumer experiences with a brand

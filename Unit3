Chapter 13: Union/Management Issues

Labor Union
—an organized group of workers that bargains with employers to improve its members’ pay, 
  job security, and working conditions.

Historival Benefits that Union has brought to Society:
  -Better Working Conditions
  -Increase Job Security
  -Better Pay (Minimum Wage Law)
  -Child Labor Laws
  -40 Hour Work Week, and more hours is overtime
  -Anti-Discrimination Laws

Strike: The members do not go to work, in hope the owners will change some aspect of their job
  -i.e better pay, better conditions
  -People do not get paid
  
Lockout: When the owners close the plant/factory to prevent the workers from working
  -The company still pays the workers

Collective Bargaining: Management and employees meeting to try to reach an agreement to end the 
  strike or lockout.

If a third party negotiator is involved to help with issues with company and employees:

Mediation: They bring in a third party, and the third party does not have any authority to force the company 
  to agree to the compensation

Arbitration: They bring in a third party, and the third party HAS THE AUTHORITY to force the company and 
  union to accept their proposed compensation

Right to Work Law: You do not have to join a union in order to work.

Open shop agreement: A person who wants to work somewhere has the right to not join a union even if
  there is one associated with the company

Sexual Harassment: Unwelcome sexual advances that create a hostile work environment
  -Can be comments, jokes, touching

Why companies dont like unions:
  -More expensive
    -More pay, more vacation time
  -Time addressing union issues
    -Greivances
  -Reputation damage
  -Strikes / Slowdowns cost
